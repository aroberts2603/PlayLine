				Terms of service<br>
				Thanks for using PlayLine.co web services. These terms of service ("Agreement") cover your use and access to the services, client software and websites ("Services") provided by PlayLine Records, a Division of Digital Fusion Music LLC.(for clarity, ?Services? include the ?Release Service? and ?Mastering Service? as defined below). OurÿPrivacy Policyÿexplains how we collect and use your information while ourÿAcceptable Use and Fair Usage Policyÿoutlines your responsibilities when using our Services.<br>
				By using our Services, you're agreeing to be bound by the terms of this Agreement, and to review ourÿPrivacy and Acceptable Use and Fair Usage Policyÿ. If you're using our Services for an organization, you're agreeing to the terms of this Agreement on behalf of that organization.
				By using or accessing the Services, you agree to all the terms and conditions stated in this Agreement. If, at any time, you do not or cannot agree to the terms of this Agreement, you must stop accessing or using the Services.
				Your Assets & Your Permissions
				When you use our Services, you provide us with things like your files, content, configuration settings, Metadata and so on ("Your Assets"). Your Assets are yours. The terms of this Agreement don't give us any rights to Your Assets except for the limited rights that enable us to offer the Services.
				If you want to use our Release Service for your Recordings (as defined below), please carefully review all applicable provisions of the terms of this Agreement.
				We need your permission to do things like hosting Your Assets, backing them up, and sharing them when you ask us to. Our Services also provide you with features like song previews, editing, sharing, searching and releasing. These and other features may require our systems to access, store and scan Your Assets. We may also utilize Your Data (as defined in our Privacy Policy) to conduct investigations and studies, test functionalities during the development phase and analyze the information at our disposal to assess and improve our Services, implement new services and functionalities and perform audits and troubleshooting procedures, or for promotional purposes. You give us permission to do these things, and this permission extends to trusted third parties we work with.
				Sharing Your Assets
				Our Services let you share Your Assets with others, so please think carefully about what you share. You understand that you assume all risks, including unwanted public release, related to your decision to share Your Assets. When you share Your Assets, you?re responsible for ensuring that those accessing Your Assets understand what they?re allowed to do, or not do, with Your Assets. Your sharing of Your Assets via our Services will not entitle you to any payments from any persons participating in our Services.
				When content is shared to you, offering comments, suggestions, and/or feedback to another user?s content on the PlayLine site does not mean that you acquire ownership rights or credits in that content nor does it mean that you shall have a right to any royalties or other monetary payments derived from that content. Without written approval from the party owning the content that was shared with you, you cannot share or reproduce the other user?s content. To obtain more information about your rights as a contributor, songwriter, or performer, please consult your performing rights organization, publisher, and/or legal counsel.
				Pricing
				Our pricing aims to be affordable to allow as many creators as possible, from all over the world, to use our Services. You can increase your privileges and add paid features to your account (turning your account into a "Paid?, ?Premium? Account). Please refer to PlayLine?s website for all details regarding our free offer, A-la-Carte offers and subscription plans for our Services and for further details relating to upgrades, downgrades, billing, refunds, and changes to Paid accounts. Both free and paying users must have a PlayLine account to be able to use our Services.
				Copyright
				We respect the intellectual property of others and ask that you do too. We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement if they comply with the law, and such notices should be reported to us by email. We reserve the right to delete or disable content alleged to be infringing and terminate accounts of repeat infringers. Our designated agent for notice of alleged copyright infringement on the Services is:ÿcopyright@PlayLine.co
				Our Release Service
				Our Release Service allows you to make your Recordings (as defined below) available to digital stores, streaming services and other digital services and resellers selected by PlayLine (?Digital Stores?). The Digital Stores may then offer your Recordings for download or streaming to their clients (collectively, ?Online Exploitations?).
				Your Recordings
				By a ?Recording?, we mean a musical sound or audiovisual recording (including, unless otherwise stated herein, in the case of a sound recording, any music, lyrics and instrumental and/or vocal performances recorded thereon, including any Samples as may be incorporated therein pursuant to the Samples Licence, as the case may be, and in the case of an audiovisual recording, any sound recording reproduced thereon and any script, direction, music and lyrics or other works, any likeness and/or voice, and any visual, audiovisual, instrumental and/or vocal performances recorded on such audiovisual recording or on any sound recording reproduced thereon), which is uploaded to your PlayLine account, and that you ask us to make available to the public through our Release Service.
				Release to Digital Stores
				We will make your Recordings available to the Digital Stores that you selected, but in many instances, you will not be able to select the countries or geographical regions in which your Recordings will be made available. You are authorizing us to make your Recordings available anywhere in the world. Therefore, you must have worldwide rights on your Recordings, including on any music, lyrics and instrumental and/or vocal performances recorded thereon; if you do not have all such rights on a Recording (including on any other Recording, on any music, lyrics or other works, or on any instrumental, vocal or other performance recorded or reproduced thereon) in any region, you shall not release your Recordings with our Release Service.
				Although you can choose the Digital Stores where you want to offer your Recordings, you understand that we must enter into certain agreements with these Digital Stores, and that we have sole discretion in deciding with which Digital Stores we conclude agreements, and under what terms and conditions. You understand that the terms of this Agreement will be subject to the agreements that we enter into with the Digital Stores.
				We will try to provide your Recordings to the selected Digital Stores as quickly as possible. Please understand however that it can take anywhere between a few hours to several weeks for certain Digital Stores before they make your Recordings available to their clients, and that we do not have any control on the internal process and delays of a Digital Store.
				A Digital Store may also decide not to offer (or remove) some of or all your Recordings in certain or all countries, in accordance with their policies and practices. We cannot force them to offer your Recordings. If our agreement with a Digital Store expires or terminates, we will then cease offering your Recordings to that Digital Store. If this happens, we will notify you as soon as we can.
				Payments
				We will transfer to you one hundred percent (100%) of the Net Income we receive from Digital Stores. ?Net Income? means the actual amounts that we receive from Digital Stores which are directly attributable to the Online Exploitation of your Recordings, less any refunds, taxes, tariffs, fees, royalties (other than Covered Mechanical Royalties) or other charges related to the Online Exploitation of your Recordings, including currency conversion fees or payment processing fees incurred in the process to transfer you such money (such as PayPal). We may also keep a small portion of your Net income to cover any additional cost(s) that may have occurred in your account.
				We will use our best efforts to post to your account your Net Income within fifteen (15) business days of receipt. Please understand that there will usually be a delay of between forty-five (45) and ninety (90) days between the day a Digital Store streams or downloads your Recording and the day we receive payment of your Net Income.
				Once the Net Income has been credited to your account, you will be able to withdraw all or any portion thereof at your discretion. You will be responsible for any bank fees (including currency conversion fees) or other charges related to such withdrawals. If you owe us any amounts, we have the right to deduct all or a portion of such amounts from any Net Income otherwise payable to you.
				You understand and accept that we will pay NO interest on any Net Income balance in your account, even if we might receive interest or earnings on such balance. In addition, if you make your music jointly available with any person participating in the creation or performance of any musical work and/or lyrics included on your Recording and/or in the production or making of your Recordings (such as any composers, lyricists, musicians, singers, music producers, sound recording makers or others), you will be solely responsible for making any payment to any such person as may be due in consideration for any such rights. For greater certainty, except as may be otherwise set forth herein this last sentence does not apply to any author, composer, performer, producer or maker associated with any Samples incorporated in your Recordings in accordance with the Samples Licence, nor to the payment to any author and composer of any Cover Song as may be incorporated in your Recordings, of any Cover Mechanical Royalties for any Cover Mechanical Reproductions of such Cover Song pursuant to any Cover Song Licence.
				We have the right to rely on accounting, usage and other statements received from the Digital Stores for all purposes, but we have no obligation to audit or otherwise contest the income calculations or statements given to us by the Digital Stores. If you ask us to proceed to an audit of a Digital Store and we accept, at our sole discretion, to proceed, you will be responsible for all audit fees (and we can ask you to pay us in advance or may deduct such audit fees from the Net Income in your account). Any objection relating to the Net Income calculations and payment, or any lawsuit arising therefrom must be made (and any lawsuit commenced) no later than one (1) year after the date the Net Income is posted to your account, and you hereby waive any longer statute of limitations that may be permitted by law, in any jurisdiction.
				Metadata
				Digital Stores require that we provide certain information with your Recordings, mostly in the form of metadata, such as artwork images, artist name, logo, trademarks, service marks, song and album titles, biographical and other information ("Metadata"). You must own all necessary rights in any such information that you provide. We will ask for this information when you select to send a Recording to a Digital Store. You are responsible for providing us with all the required information, and if we or a Digital Store request that you correct any error, you make the correction as soon as possible. A failure to correct these errors could delay or prevent the release of your Recordings to the requested Digital Stores.
				Universal Products Codes and International Standard Recording Codes
				We may provide universal product codes (UPC) or International Standard Recording Codes (ISRC) for your Recordings. These codes are provided to PlayLine.co, and you cannot transfer them to yourself or someone else. An ISRC is required for any Recording released to a Digital Store. Each Recording must have its own ISRC. You will need to provide the ISRC for your Recording when you ask us to release it. If you don?t have a ISRC for your Recording, we can provide one.
				If you ask us to provide an ISRC, it means that you authorize us to use all necessary information (including the identity of the rights owner on whose behalf the ISRC was assigned, and reference metadata about the recording including the artist name, track title, version, year of first publication, track duration and other relevant data) and to maintain records of such information.
				You cannot ask for an ISRC if you already have one for your Recording.
				Advisory Warnings
				You will be responsible for determining the advisory warning status for your Recording, including parental advisory status, and if an advisory is required by applicable law or regulation, or if you otherwise deem it appropriate, you will provide an advisory warning for your Recording when you ask us to release it. You will not deliver for Online Exploitation by us a Recording and any artwork, images, lyrics or other Metadata or material that has been rejected or banned by a competent government authority in a country where we will release your Recording.
				Grant of Rights
				PlayLine works for and on behalf of musicians and creators. So, you are NOT assigning or transferring us any copyright or ownership rights on your Recordings, but only granting us the non-exclusive rights and licenses described in this Agreement.
				To allow us to provide you with our Release Service, you hereby grant us all the rights necessary for the Online Exploitation of your Recordings and any Metadata through Digital Stores. More precisely, you grant us the non-exclusive, sublicensable right and license, throughout the world, to:
				o Reproduce and to communicate your Recordings to the public by telecommunication (including to make your Recording available to the public by wire or wireless means in such ways that members of the public may access your Recordings from any place and at any time individually chosen by them), and to authorize Digital Stores to do any of the foregoing (including to authorise their clients to make reproductions of your Recordings) in any formats and though any media (now known or existing in the future), including, without limitation, permanent, temporary, limited and portable digital downloads, interactive, semi-interactive or non-interactive streaming, and cloud services;
				o To create, reproduce and stream, and to authorize Digital Stores to create, reproduce and stream and authorise their clients to reproduce free preview clips of your Recordings;
				o To use all name(s), photographs, likenesses, voice, artwork images, artist name, logo, trademarks, service marks, music or song and album titles, biographical and other information provided by you (in Metadata or otherwise) in connection with the Online Exploitation of your Recordings on the Digital Stores, and in any of our or the Digital Stores advertising or promotional materials. We will ask for your written approval before using any name or likeness as an endorsement of our Services and websites or of a Digital Store;
				o To reproduce, integrate and communicate your Recordings to the public via lists of readers of the Digital Stores. You may revoke such authorization at any time by way of written notice to PlayLine, in which case, PlayLine shall remove your Recordings from said readers lists within 30 business days of receipt of the written notice from PlayLine;
				o To collect all income (including the Net Income) from the Digital Stores in connection with the Online Exploitation of your Recordings.
				The rights, licenses and guarantees that you grant us do not, however, cover the exploitation of any exclusive right over any musical work (music with or without lyrics) included in your Recordings to the extent the exploitation in question of this right has already been authorized by a copyright collective society entitled to grant such authorization.
				Your Responsibilities
				You're responsible for your conduct, Your Assets and you must comply with ourÿAcceptable Use and Fair Usage Policy. Content in the Services may be protected by others' intellectual property rights. Please don't copy, upload, download or share content unless you have the right to do so. We may review your conduct and content for compliance with the terms of this Agreement and ourÿAcceptable Use and Fair Usage Policy. That said, we have no obligation to do so. We aren't responsible for the content people post and share via the Services.
				Regarding third parties? rights and payments, you are solely responsible:
				o To obtain any right required in other for us to make and authorise any Online Exploitation of your Recordings, Metadata or other information or material you may provide us with to the full extent authorised herein from any person participating in the creation or performance of any work (such as music, lyrics, scripts or direction) included on your Recording and/or in the production or making of your Recordings (such as any composers, lyricists, scriptwriters, directors, musicians, singers, actors, extras, music producers, sound or audiovisual recording makers or others) or who may otherwise own or control any such right (such as music publishers or copyright collectives);
				o To make any payment to any such person as may be due in consideration for any such rights;
				o To pay to any person who may be entitled thereto, any share of any payment of Net Incomes made by us to you as may be due and payable to any such persons except to the extent we have been required by you, are able to, and actually pay such share(s) of such payment to such persons;
				o To pay all amounts that may be required under collective bargaining agreement, copyright tariffs, or statutory schemes;

				o To pay for any required music publishing licenses for your Recordings;
				o To pay for all taxes or other governmental withholdings.
				The responsibilities above do not apply in respect of authors, composers, performers, producers or makers associated with any Samples incorporated in your Recordings in accordance with the Samples Licence as set forth herein nor to Cover Mechanical Reproductions of any Cover Song incorporated in your Recordings for which we have been able to obtain a Cover Song License and to Covered Mechanical Royalties payables to authors and composers of such Covered Songs pursuant to such Cover Song Licenses.
				If for any reason we make one of these payments for your Recordings, we will have the right to deduct it from any amount payable to you, including the Net Income (and require reimbursement for any outstanding balance).

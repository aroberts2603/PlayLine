# About

This was my first website I got paid to design and make, but more importantly the first long-term commited project I started. I redesigned the website probably 10 times over the course of development.  
This project was to make an online record label like TuneCore but the person I was working with decided to stop development and the codebase wasn't near finished.
I might return to finish this project someday but probably not.

# What I Learned

- How to manage and plan long-term projects better in the future (this one went poorly)
- How to divide and manage different css/js files for multi-paged websites
- More practice at reading documentation (read docs for AWS and Firebase)
